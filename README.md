## How do you play the game?

1. Guess the word with the amount of letters the answer box says.
2. If the user correctly guessed the word, the program stops shows the word and shows how many tries the user had to make.
3. The character box gets yellow if it is in the wrong positions, green if it is in the correct position and no color if it is not in the word.
4. The user always has 5 tries to guess the word, else the user lost the game and the word gets shown.
