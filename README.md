## How do you play the game?

The user Guess the word. 

The word gets checked if it has 5 letters, and gets shown on the screen.  
If the letter is in the correct position the box color is green, else the box color is yellow.  


When the word is guessed, it will show that the user has won, and how many tries he had to make.  
If the word is not guessed, the screen will show that the user lost, and what the word was.  

The user has a maximum of 5 chances to guess the word.
