# Lingo

This was a school project to learn Javascript


## How do you play the game?

The user must type a word in the empty input.
The word gets checked if it has 5 characters, and gets put on the screen.
When the word is guessed, it will show that the user has won.
If the word is not guessed, the screen will show that the user lost, and what the word was.


The user has a maximum of 5 chances to guess the word.
